        MACD, MACD Signal and MACD difference.
        The MACD Line oscillates above and below the zero line, which is also known as the centerline.
        These crossovers signal that the 12-day EMA has crossed the 26-day EMA. The direction, of course, depends on the direction of the moving average cross.
        Positive MACD indicates that the 12-day EMA is above the 26-day EMA. Positive values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further from the longer EMA.
        This means upside momentum is increasing. Negative MACD values indicates that the 12-day EMA is below the 26-day EMA.
        Negative values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further below the longer EMA. This means downside momentum is increasing.

        Signal line crossovers are the most common MACD signals. The signal line is a 9-day EMA of the MACD Line.
        As a moving average of the indicator, it trails the MACD and makes it easier to spot MACD turns.
        A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line.
        A bearish crossover occurs when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line.
